# MentorLed Task One Solution

## Problem Statement
Brief: Create a REST API with two endpoints:
GET /quotes – returns a list of quotes
POST /quotes – adds a new quote (basic validation required)
Use an in-memory array or file-based storage.
Include Postman collection or cURL instructions.

## Notes
I decided to go with an in-memory array as the database because file-based storage could have performance overhead due to reading and writing I/O operations.
